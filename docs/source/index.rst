googletrends's documentation!
==============================

``googletrends`` is Python package to examine trending google searches on geographical location and across time for input keywords. It will summarize the results per country/region and/or per time-frame and with(out) a specific keyword. 

``googletrends`` uses the trending information on spatio and temporal space for input queries. Data is al arround us. Some data is easy to get, others not. Especially when it comes to what people are "thinking" related to an issue/brand/company can be though. However, the "thinking" process can supported by googling about the subject. So if we know what people are searching for, it can give insights in the "common" thoughts. 


There are three main functionalities to reveal insights in the topics of interest:

	* Search Timewise (Temporal)
	* Search Geographically (Spatio)
	* Search Trending
